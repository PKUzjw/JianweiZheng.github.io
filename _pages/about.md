I'm a Ph.D student in [the School of Software](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](http://info.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.jsp). I obtained B.S. in Computer Science from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in 2019.

My research interests lie in the intersection of cloud computing, networking, and artificial intelligence (AI). I enjoy building systems and tools to foster the development of the world.
