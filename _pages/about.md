I am currently a Ph.D. student at [the School of Software](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](http://info.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.jsp), advised by [Prof. Zhenhua Li](http://www.greenorbs.org/people/lzh/).
My research interests lie in the fields of mobile computing, cloud computing/storage, and Web.
I am currently devoted to fostering Web application performance by leveraging the newly proposed WebAssembly.
I also find interest in crypto computing, such as smart contract and cryptocurrency mining.
I enjoy building systems and tools to foster the development of the world.

Prior to joining Tsinghua University, I spent 4 wonderful years at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), China, obtaining a B.S. in Computer Science at EECS.
